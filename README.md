I created this app to help me better manage tasks and display a background image from unsplash randomly that is in a category I like. 
I like to use the pomodoro technique with 45 min focus 5 minute break sessions. This really helps with productivity and focus.

I also created a backend to hide my api keys, I did this a different way for each api. 

I chose the current file structure because this is what netlify likes and it makes the build proccess easier. 

in the html file you can find the html, the css file contains pure css which is responsive to smaller screen sizes.

the javascript file contains several different functions. 

I created my own clock and timer using Javascript. If you have never done this before it can actually be a little tricky
because javascript set timeout and setinterval are not accurate for a clock or timer. 
to create an accurate timer you need to use the javascript current date/ time function to call this and adjust your
clock if it is off. 

Also I have the code for a task manager I created to add daily tasks to. I like to every morning plan my day with the 
most important tasks I need to complete.
